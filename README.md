NOTE - ALL SHOULD BE DONE AS SEPERATE TASKS

1. Download the latest code ! (Do not clone it since you already have cloned it)

2. Add one line below and send me the pull request.

3. Try to add another line directly to the master branch

4. Work in groups of 2 and try to merge your statements in one branch and then merge it to the master branch.git

5. Add another line, 
    - Add it to staging area - then remove it from staging area.
    - Commit the changes - then uncommit the changes.
    - Push the changes - and undo the push.
